1. Brainstormed ideas
2. Narrowed down ideas by testing potential APIs 
3. Listed out desired features and stretch features
4. Drew out user journey, design layout and file structure
5. Planned a list of steps to ensure said functionality
6. Deployed basic page to Heroku
7. Wrote all functions as a group of 3
8. Styled the page
