  <h2>
  A brief background
  </h2>
  <p>
  I went to William Ellis School, a state school in London and then went to University of Bristol to study Accounting and Finance. I first caught the tech bug when at university starting a tech business with a friend. The business collapsed ironically due to the fact that I had no understanding of tech or how to even build a website. Having enjoyed my first dip into the tech industry, I started working as a sales assistant in several tech-startups making calls and sending emails but even whilst working there, I felt myself drawn to the programmers and trying to discover more about the tech stack that was used to build the websites and applications that I worked for. After an incredibly tricky past couple of years after losing my job which very nearly led to me not having a place to stay and having to rely on support from friends and family, I decided earlier this year to start dipping my toe back into tech again, and I’ve never looked back!
  <br>
  I have loved working through these pre-requisites and can’t thank Founders & Coders enough for the support and teaching throughout the process. Especially to Dan (who I met at the first meet up I attended earlier this year), Yvonne (who seems to always be there to answer questions on Gitter) and also Michael (for imparting his knowledge every week). I have thoroughly enjoyed every step and can’t wait to bag my first job in the tech sector eventually!

  An interesting fact about me
  </h2>
  <p>
  I am an Ashkanazi Jew and love volunteering. I volunteer with the homeless at Crisis, with refugees weekly and also work with Hackney City Council to teach entrepreneurial skills to young people in need including technical skills, financial skills and career/new business planning. I also strongly believe that if you help others, you can help to alleviate the systemic bias which form obstacles for minorities and those with less money from learning skills and getting ahead in their respective careers.
